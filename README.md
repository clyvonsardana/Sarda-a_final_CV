# Enhancing Teacher Efficiency Through Implementation of Language-Vision Model

The recruitment of qualified teachers is a critical challenge for educational institutions, particularly in ensuring both efficiency and quality in the hiring process. 
Traditional recruitment methods often involve manual screening of resumes, subjective evaluations, and time-consuming interviews, 
which can lead to inefficiencies and potential biases. With the advancement of artificial intelligence, specifically Language-Vision Models (LVMs), 
there is an opportunity to revolutionize HR processes in the MATS system.
